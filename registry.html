          <h1>Registry</h1>
          <p>
            We have been fortunate to benefit in life and love. 
            The only gift we want is your continued relationship and your presence at our wedding. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We appreciate the travel arrangements (some from different states, and even countries) that 
            some of you will make for this wedding. However, if you are considering a gift, we encourage 
            you to commemorate our wedding with a donation to a charity of your choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you need assistance with picking a charity, you can refer to this website:

              If you want to give a gift, we'd prefer you give one to the charity of your choice. 
              BUT! if you are really so SOOOOO inclined to give something to us - JKhoo 
              appreciates any kind of dining experience ;)
